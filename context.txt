Project: Zod Form Generator

Description:
This project is a form generator that creates Next.js components with server-side actions using Zod for schema validation, React Hook Form for form state management, and Shadcn UI for styling. It uses the next-safe-action library to create type-safe server actions.

Key Components:
1. safe_action_form_generator.py: The main Python script that generates the TypeScript/React components.
2. Generated Files:
   a. {form_name}_server_actions.ts: Contains the server-side action logic.
   b. {form_name}_form.tsx: The React component for the form.

Technologies Used:
- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Zod (for schema validation)
- next-safe-action (for type-safe server actions)
- React Hook Form (for form state management)
- Shadcn UI (for UI components and styling)
- Streamlit (for the form generator interface)

Key Features:
1. Type-safe form generation with Zod schemas
2. Server-side actions using next-safe-action
3. Client-side form handling with React Hook Form
4. Styled components using Shadcn UI
5. Toast notifications for form submission feedback
6. Error handling for both client and server-side validation

File Structure:
zod_form_generator/
- safe_action_form_generator.py
- utils.py (contains helper functions like generate_zod_schema)
- requirements.txt
- Generated files:
  - {form_name}_server_actions.ts
  - {form_name}_form.tsx

Usage:
1. Run the Streamlit app (safe_action_form_generator.py)
2. Enter the form name and define fields
3. Generate the Next.js Safe Action Form
4. Review the generated TypeScript files
5. Save the files to use in a Next.js project

Note: The generated components assume the existence of a Shadcn UI setup in the Next.js project. Users may need to adjust import paths or install necessary dependencies in their Next.js project.

Future Improvements:
1. Add more field types and customization options
2. Generate a complete Next.js project structure
3. Include options for different styling libraries
4. Add unit test generation for the created components
